# "Motivational Quotes" Example Alexa Skill

An example Alexa skill that when prompted randomly outputs a motivational quote from a REST API.

In this case I used this [API](https://forismatic.com/en/api/).

You can get the skill [here](https://www.amazon.com/Anthony-Dinh-Motivational-Quotes/dp/B073WX96MP/ref=sr_1_3?s=digital-skills)

## Prereqs

You will need an Amazon & AWS account since you're creating an Alexa Skill and this skill uses an AWS Lambda Function (It's by far the easiest way to create an Alexa Skill)


Take a look at the docs for getting an Alexa Skill [here](https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/docs/registering-and-managing-alexa-skills-in-the-developer-portal).

Take a look at the docs for getting a Lambda function [here](https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/docs/developing-an-alexa-skill-as-a-lambda-function).
